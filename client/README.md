This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## 1 - Installation Packages

Ensure that Node and Yarn are installed on your machine before running the next command.

```bash
$ yarn install
```

## 2 - Main Files Configurations

All: [`.env`](.env)

Development: [`.env.development`](.env.development)

Production: [`.env.prodution`](.env.production)

## 3 - Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
#start development
yarn dev

#start if production
yarn start

#if build prodution
yarn build
```

Open [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
